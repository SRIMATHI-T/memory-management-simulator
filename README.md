# 📦 Memory Allocation Simulator

A simple, interactive web-based simulator to visualize how memory allocation works in operating systems using **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit** memory allocation strategies.

---

## 📸 Demo

Simulate memory allocation by entering memory block sizes and process sizes, choosing a strategy, and clicking **Allocate Memory** to see how each process is allocated and the resulting internal fragmentation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 Clean, responsive front-end layout.
- 🎛️ Supports **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit** allocation strategies.
- 🖥️ Real-time memory allocation visualization.
- 📊 Displays internal fragmentation for each allocated memory block.
- ✏️ Customizable initial memory and process values.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter your desired memory block sizes and process sizes in KB.
4. Choose an allocation strategy from the dropdown.
5. Click **Allocate Memory** and view the result!

## 📚 Allocation Strategies Explained

- **First Fit:** Allocates the first available memory block large enough for the process.
- **Best Fit:** Allocates the smallest memory block that is still large enough for the process, reducing fragmentation.
- **Worst Fit:** Allocates the largest available memory block to the process, leaving the most leftover space.
